# Dribble Challenges

A series of small projects to implement interesting UI designs on Dribble.

## Dial pad View

Under pinned by a collection view and standard flow layout, I added some display logic for the cell gradients and layout constraints to ensure a fixed number of cells remain on screen but also fill the space available. 
The same view can then also be customised and used for the pin display.
